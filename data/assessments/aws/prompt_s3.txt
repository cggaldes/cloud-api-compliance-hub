- Category: Vulnerability Management & Patching, Criterion: Vulnerability Scanning, Description: Evidence of regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
- Category: Compliance & Certifications, Criterion: Industry Certifications, Description: Adherence to relevant industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR).
- Category: Compliance & Certifications, Criterion: Compliance Documentation, Description: Availability of compliance reports.
- Category: Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Criterion: Sensitive Data Scanning, Description: Integration with DLP services.
- Category: Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Criterion: Data Masking/Redaction, Description: Ability to mask or redact sensitive information.
- Category: Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL), Criterion: API Design Principles, Description: Adherence to secure API design principles.
- Category: Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL), Criterion: Code Review & Testing, Description: Evidence of secure coding practices and security testing.


    **Instructions:**
    For each criterion listed above, evaluate the service and provide a detailed assessment. Your response must be a series of newline-delimited JSON objects. Each JSON object represents a single criterion assessment and must conform to the following structure:
    {
      "api_name": "S3",
      "api_domain_name": "s3.amazonaws.com",
      "platform": "aws",
      "is_endorsed": false,
      "criterion_category": "...",
      "criterion_name": "...",
      "is_supported": boolean,
      "caveats": "...",
      "notes": "..."
    }

    **Field Definitions:**
    - `api_name`: The friendly name of the API (e.g., "Cloud Storage").
    - `api_domain_name`: The domain name of the API (e.g., "storage.googleapis.com").
    - `platform`: The cloud platform identifier (e.g., "gcp", "aws", "azure").
    - `is_endorsed`: Always set this to `false`. It is for internal use.
    - `criterion_category`: The category of the criterion being assessed.
    - `criterion_name`: The name of the specific criterion.
    - `is_supported`: A boolean (`true` or `false`) indicating if the service meets the criterion.
    - `caveats`: A brief, clear string explaining any limitations, conditions, or partial support. If fully supported, leave this empty. Examples: "Supported with limitations.", "Applicable for user accounts only."
    - `notes`: A detailed, comprehensive explanation of *how* the service supports (or fails to support) the criterion. Provide specifics, including names of relevant features, configurations, or best practices.

    **IMPORTANT:**
    - Your final output must be **only the newline-delimited JSON objects**, with no surrounding text, explanations, or markdown formatting.
    - Ensure each JSON object is on a new line.
    - Base your assessment on publicly available documentation for the service.
